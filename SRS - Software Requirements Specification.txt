1. Introduction

1.1 Purpose

The purpose of this Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document is to provide a detailed description of the Alumni Database Management System. It outlines the system's functionality, constraints, and requirements necessary for development.

1.2 Scope

The Alumni Database Management System is designed to efficiently store, manage, and retrieve information related to university alumni. It will serve as a comprehensive platform for alumni data management, allowing authorized users to access and update alumni records.

1.3 Document Conventions

    Use of "shall" to indicate mandatory requirements.
    Use of "should" to indicate preferred, but not mandatory, requirements.
    Use of "may" to indicate optional features.

2. Overall Description

2.1 Product Perspective

The Alumni Database Management System is a standalone web-based (python's streamlit) application that interacts with a relational database to store and retrieve alumni information. It will be developed using modern web technologies.

2.2 User Classes and Characteristics

    Admin: The admin user will have full access to the system and can manage alumni records, users, and system settings.
    Alumni: Alumni users can log in, view their profiles, update information, and connect with other alumni.
    Guests: Guests can view public alumni profiles but cannot access sensitive information.

2.3 Operating Environment

The system will be deployed on a web server and accessible via standard web browsers. It will require a database management system (e.g., MySQL) and a web server (e.g., Apache).

2.4 Design and Implementation Constraints

    The system will be developed using python's streamlit for the frontend.
    It must comply with relevant data protection laws (e.g., GDPR).
    The system should be compatible with modern web browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
